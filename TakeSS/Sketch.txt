        4.Take scrrenshots within a loop
        5.Save screenshot user defined location

Usege :
    TakeSS [-c] <stX stY edX edY> [-i] <interval> [-s] <sleeptime> [ [-l] looptime | [-n] loopcount ] [-h] savepath

    interval = duration betwenn two screenshots in seconds
    sleeptime = duration for delay to take ss
    stX = starting X coordinate
    stY = starting Y coordinate
    edX = ending X coordinate
    edY = ending Y coordinate
    -h = hide ss after taking
